<h4>About Us</h4>
<div class="box">
  <div class="left">
    <p>Happy Tails Animal Rescue is a nonprofit 501Â© (3) organization located in Northern Colorado. We serve companion animals and strive
        to provide the highest quality care possible. We work with a wide network of volunteer veterinarians, foster families and volunteers
        to further our cause to the animals we care for. These animals are unable to speak for themselves, so we give them a voice during the 
        difficult time. All animals deserve dignity and a safe place to call home. <br><br>
        If you agree with our mission, please consider a donation, becoming a foster, volunteering or adopting. Our volunteers
        are available if you or someone you know needs to surrender an animal. We mainly serve Northern Colorado but have sister rescues
        that we can contact if you need assistance in other areas.
